# Rule-Based Expert System using Certainty Factor

## Overview
This project is a Job Suggestion Expert System built using Python and the `customtkinter` library. The system suggests suitable job roles based on user-defined skills and their confidence levels. It uses a set of predefined rules and conditions to evaluate the best job matches (currently only for engineering jobs).
